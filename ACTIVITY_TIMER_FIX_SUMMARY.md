# Activity Timer Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The global activity timer was sometimes counting inactive time even when the agent was actually active. This caused inaccurate productivity tracking and frustrated users who were working but seeing their inactive time increase.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem was caused by **multiple sources of truth** for activity state that could get out of sync:

1. **Server state** (`timerData.isActive`) - from database
2. **Local state** (`lastActivityState`) - from client-side tracking
3. **Activity tracking** - from Electron mouse/keyboard monitoring

When these sources conflicted, the system would sometimes:
- Trust stale local state over fresh server state
- Count inactive time when the user was actually active
- Fail to validate inactive states properly

## Specific Problems Found

### 1. Timer Counting Logic (timer-context.tsx)
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Problematic
const isActive = timerData ? timerData.isActive : lastActivityState
if (isActive) {
  setLiveActiveSeconds(prev => prev + 1)
} else {
  setLiveInactiveSeconds(prev => prev + 1)  // ← Could count inactive when user is active
}
```

### 2. Activity Status Determination (use-activity-status.ts)
- No validation of inactive states
- Could default to inactive when state was unclear
- No fallback logic for conflicting information

### 3. Socket Synchronization (use-socket-timer.ts)
- No validation of received timer data
- Could propagate invalid states
- Race conditions in periodic updates

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Timer Counting Logic
- **Priority-based state determination**: Server state > Local state > Fallback
- **Conservative inactive counting**: Only count inactive when confident
- **Validation function**: `validateInactiveState()` prevents false inactive counting
- **Default to active**: When state is unclear, assume active to prevent false inactive

### 2. Enhanced Activity Status Logic
- **Server state priority**: Trust server over local when available
- **State validation**: Double-check inactive states before applying
- **Conflict resolution**: Handle conflicting information gracefully
- **Error handling**: Default to active on errors to prevent false inactive

### 3. Better Socket Synchronization
- **Data validation**: Only process valid timer data
- **Activity state sync**: Keep local and server states in sync
- **Race condition prevention**: Validate data before periodic updates
- **Event emission**: Notify other components of state changes

## Key Improvements

### Conservative Inactive Counting
```typescript
// NEW CODE - Safe inactive counting
if (isActive) {
  setLiveActiveSeconds(prev => prev + 1)
} else {
  // Only count inactive if we're confident the user is actually inactive
  const shouldCountInactive = validateInactiveState(timerData, lastActivityState)
  
  if (shouldCountInactive) {
    setLiveInactiveSeconds(prev => prev + 1)
  } else {
    // If we can't validate inactive state, default to active
    setLiveActiveSeconds(prev => prev + 1)
  }
}
```

### State Validation
```typescript
const validateInactiveState = (timerData, lastActivityState) => {
  // If server explicitly says inactive, trust it
  if (timerData && timerData.isActive === false) {
    return true
  }
  
  // If local state says inactive but server says active, don't trust local
  if (lastActivityState === false && timerData && timerData.isActive === true) {
    return false
  }
  
  // Only count inactive if we have clear, consistent inactive state
  return lastActivityState === false
}
```

### Server State Priority
```typescript
// Priority order: server state > local state > fallback
if (serverActivityState !== undefined) {
  isActive = serverActivityState  // Trust server as primary source
} else if (localActivityState !== null) {
  isActive = localActivityState   // Fall back to local
} else {
  isActive = true                 // Default to active (prevents false inactive)
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates false inactive counting** - Users won't see inactive time when they're working
2. **Improves accuracy** - Better synchronization between server and client states
3. **Prevents race conditions** - Validates data before processing
4. **Better debugging** - Logs state changes and validation failures
5. **Conservative approach** - When in doubt, assumes active (safer for productivity)

## Testing
The system should now:
- Only count inactive time when confident the user is actually inactive
- Trust server state over local state when available
- Default to active counting when state is unclear
- Provide better logging for debugging activity issues
- Handle conflicting information gracefully

## Monitoring
Watch for:
- No more false inactive time counting
- Consistent activity state between server and client
- Proper validation logs for inactive states
- Better synchronization during state changes
- Reduced race conditions in timer updates
