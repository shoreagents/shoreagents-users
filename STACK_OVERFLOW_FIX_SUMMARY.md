# Stack Overflow Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The system was experiencing "stack depth limit exceeded" errors around 8:30-8:32 AM, which prevented the shift reset monitoring from running properly. This caused the system to miss shift resets during critical timing windows.

## Root Cause
The problem was caused by **three overlapping intervals** all calling the same functions simultaneously:

1. **Main interval**: Every 30 seconds
2. **Quick interval**: Every 10 seconds  
3. **Ultra-fast interval**: Every 500ms

These overlapping intervals were creating a cascade effect where multiple calls to `checkShiftReset`, `getTimeUntilNextReset`, and related functions could create recursive call chains that exceeded the stack depth limit.

## Functions Affected
The following functions were potentially causing stack overflow:
- `getTimeUntilNextReset()`
- `getNextShiftStart()`
- `getShiftStartForDate()`
- `shouldResetForShift()`
- `checkShiftReset()`
- `getCurrentShiftId()`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Consolidated Intervals
- **Removed** the three overlapping intervals
- **Replaced** with a single, more efficient interval that runs every 15 seconds
- **Eliminated** the cascade effect that was causing stack overflow

### 2. Added Error Handling
- **Wrapped** all critical functions in try-catch blocks
- **Added** fallback values when calculations fail
- **Prevented** errors from propagating up the call stack

### 3. Added Parameter Validation
- **Added** null/undefined checks for function parameters
- **Provided** safe fallback values for invalid inputs
- **Prevented** functions from being called with invalid data

### 4. Improved Logging
- **Maintained** all critical timing logs
- **Added** error logging for debugging
- **Kept** the same user experience while improving stability

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates** stack overflow errors
2. **Maintains** responsive shift reset monitoring (15-second intervals)
3. **Preserves** all critical timing functionality
4. **Improves** system stability and error recovery
5. **Reduces** CPU usage from overlapping intervals

## Testing
The system should now:
- Run without stack overflow errors
- Continue monitoring shift resets every 15 seconds
- Log critical timing information as before
- Handle errors gracefully with fallbacks
- Maintain the same user experience

## Monitoring
Watch for:
- No more "stack depth limit exceeded" errors
- Consistent shift reset monitoring every 15 seconds
- Proper error logging when issues occur
- Stable system performance during shift transitions
