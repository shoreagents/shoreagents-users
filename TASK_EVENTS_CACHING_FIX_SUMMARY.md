# Task Events Caching Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When switching between tasks in the task detail dialog, events from the previous task were still being displayed even when the new task had no events. This caused confusion as users would see activity history from a different task.

## Root Cause
The problem was **frontend state caching** in the React component. Specifically:

1. **Events State Persistence**: The `events` state array was not being cleared when switching tasks
2. **State Merging Logic**: The original code was merging events from the previous task with new task events instead of replacing them
3. **Missing Cleanup**: No comprehensive cleanup when switching between tasks

## The Problematic Code
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Problematic merging logic
setEvents(prev => {
  const map = new Map<number, any>()
  ;[...data.events, ...prev].forEach((e: any) => { 
    if (!map.has(e.id)) map.set(e.id, e) 
  })
  return Array.from(map.values())
})
```

This code was:
- Taking events from the **previous task** (`...prev`)
- Merging them with events from the **new task** (`...data.events`)
- Using a Map to deduplicate by event ID
- **Result**: Events from the previous task would persist and be displayed

## The Fix Applied

### 1. **Immediate State Clearing**
```typescript
// Clear previous events immediately when switching tasks
setEvents([])
```

### 2. **Replace Instead of Merge**
```typescript
// Replace events completely instead of merging with previous
setEvents(data.events)
```

### 3. **Comprehensive State Cleanup**
```typescript
// Comprehensive cleanup when switching tasks
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (!isOpen || !task?.id) {
    // Clear all task-specific state when dialog is not open or no task
    setEvents([])
    setTaskComments([])
    setComment("")
    setEditingCommentId(null)
    // ... and many more state variables
  }
}, [isOpen, task?.id])
```

### 4. **Proper Cleanup on Unmount**
```typescript
// Cleanup: clear events when component unmounts or dependencies change
return () => {
  setEvents([])
}
```

## Complete Fixed Code
```typescript
// Load activity events on open
React.useEffect(() => {
  const load = async () => {
    if (!isOpen || !task?.id) return
    
    // Clear previous events immediately when switching tasks
    setEvents([])
    
    try {
      const res = await fetch(`/api/task-activity/events?task_id=${encodeURIComponent(task.id)}`)
      if (!res.ok) return
      const data = await res.json()
      if (data?.success && Array.isArray(data.events)) {
        // Replace events completely instead of merging with previous
        setEvents(data.events)
      }
    } catch {}
  }
  
  // Clear events when dialog opens or task changes
  if (isOpen && task?.id) {
    void load()
  } else {
    // Clear events when dialog is not open or no task
    setEvents([])
  }
  
  // Cleanup: clear events when component unmounts or dependencies change
  return () => {
    setEvents([])
  }
}, [isOpen, task?.id])
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Cross-Task Event Display**: Events from previous tasks are never shown
2. **Clean State Management**: Each task starts with a fresh, clean state
3. **Better User Experience**: Users only see relevant events for the current task
4. **Prevents Confusion**: No more wondering why a task shows events from another task
5. **Proper React Patterns**: Follows React best practices for state cleanup

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ **Events State**: Properly cleared when switching tasks
- ✅ **Comments State**: Cleared to prevent comment mixing
- ✅ **Form States**: All input fields reset when switching tasks
- ✅ **UI States**: All dropdowns, modals, and panels reset
- ✅ **File States**: Attachment and upload states cleared
- ✅ **Search States**: All search inputs reset

## Testing
The system should now:
- Show only events for the current task
- Clear all previous task data when switching
- Start each task with a clean, fresh state
- Never display events from other tasks
- Properly handle tasks with no events (show empty state)

## Monitoring
Watch for:
- No more events from previous tasks being displayed
- Clean state when switching between tasks
- Proper empty state for tasks with no events
- All form fields and UI elements reset properly
- No lingering data between task switches
