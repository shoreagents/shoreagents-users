# Night Shift Activity Timer Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Identified
The global activity timer was not counting for night shift agents after 12:00 AM (August 21, 2025), even though the shift (10:00 PM - 7:00 AM) was still active until 7:00 AM.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Date Mismatch**: The API and socket server were calculating different activity dates for the same night shift
2. **Multiple Records**: This created multiple activity records with different dates for the same shift
3. **Wrong Active Record**: The socket server was updating one record while the API was reading from another
4. **User Status**: The user was marked as INACTIVE in the correct record

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated API Routes ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/app/api/activity/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Replaced old date calculation logic with calls to `get_activity_date_for_shift_simple()`
- Replaced shift reset logic with calls to `should_reset_activity_simple()`
- Updated both GET and POST methods
- Updated PUT method for consistency

**Result**: API now uses consistent night shift date calculation

### 2. Fixed Activity Record Status ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Script**: `scripts/fix-activity-timer-not-counting.js`

**Changes**:
- Set user as ACTIVE in the database
- Updated `last_session_start` timestamp
- Verified the correct record was being used

**Result**: User is now marked as active and timer started counting

### 3. Resolved Date Mismatch ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Script**: `scripts/fix-activity-date-mismatch.js`

**Changes**:
- Identified API target date: `2025-08-19`
- Identified socket server target date: `2025-08-20`
- Set correct record (`2025-08-19`) as ACTIVE
- Set incorrect record (`2025-08-20`) as INACTIVE

**Result**: Correct record is now active and being updated

### 4. Updated Socket Server ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**File**: `socket-server.js`

**Changes**:
- Replaced manual date calculation with database function calls
- Added `get_activity_date_for_shift_simple()` for date calculation
- Added `should_reset_activity_simple()` for shift validation
- Added fallback to original logic if database functions fail

**Result**: Socket server now uses same date calculation as API

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Now
- **Activity timer is counting**: Last update was 7 seconds ago
- **User is ACTIVE**: Correct record is marked as active  
- **API is working**: Reading from the correct activity record
- **Database functions**: All night shift functions are working properly

### ‚è≥ Needs Socket Server Restart
- **Socket server changes**: Code updated but needs restart to take effect
- **Date synchronization**: Will be fully synchronized after restart

## Verification Results

```
Current Status (6:21 AM Manila):
‚úÖ Timer is counting (last update: 7 seconds ago)
‚úÖ User is ACTIVE in correct record
‚úÖ API reading from correct date (2025-08-19)
‚úÖ Shift is still active (ends at 7:00 AM)

Records:
- 2025-08-19 ‚úÖ ACTIVE: 1375s active, 104s inactive (CORRECT)
- 2025-08-20 üî¥ INACTIVE: 0s active, 0s inactive (FIXED)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. **Restart Socket Server**: Apply the updated date calculation logic
2. **Verify Full Fix**: Run verification script after restart
3. **Monitor**: Watch for continued activity updates

### Testing
Use these scripts to verify the fix:
- `scripts/verify-activity-timer-fix.js` - Complete verification
- `scripts/check-current-activity-status.js` - Quick status check
- `scripts/test-socket-server-shift-detection.js` - Socket server logic test

## Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/activity/route.ts` - API routes updated
- ‚úÖ `socket-server.js` - Socket server date calculation updated
- ‚úÖ Database records - Correct record set as active

## Database Functions Used
- `get_activity_date_for_shift_simple(user_id)` - Consistent date calculation
- `should_reset_activity_simple(user_id)` - Shift validation
- `get_current_shift_period(user_id)` - Shift period identification

## Expected Outcome
After socket server restart:
- ‚úÖ Activity timer will count continuously during night shift
- ‚úÖ No more midnight resets for night shift agents
- ‚úÖ Consistent date calculation across all systems
- ‚úÖ Proper "2 days roll" behavior for night shifts

## Success Metrics
- Activity updates every few seconds during active shift
- Single activity record per shift (no duplicates)
- Timer continues counting from previous day's shift start
- API and socket server use same activity date

---

**Status**: üü° **MOSTLY FIXED** - Timer is counting, needs socket server restart for complete fix
**Priority**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Affects night shift agents' activity tracking
**Next Action**: Restart socket server to complete the fix
